Negotiation is not Krux’s strong suit, and the giff turns to the
characters for help in convincing Fel to let them use the ship. A
character can do so by impressing upon her the urgency of the
party’s mission and succeeding on a [DC 18 Charisma (Intimidation
or Persuasion)] check. _The check is made with advantage if the characters refund the rest of Fel’s lease payment (400
gp)_. If the check fails, Fel is unmoved, and further attempts by that character to sway her fall on deaf ears.
If the party doesn’t have any spellcasters, Krux points out that they will need to hire a spelljammer. If the party tries to
retain Fel’s services for this purpose, the tiefling insists on a fee of 1,000 gp in addition to whatever agreement they
reach regarding her other demands. If it’s obvious the party can’t pay what she’s asking up front, Fel is willing to
accompany them in exchange for a 25 percent share of any treasure they find until she is paid in full.
If the party threatens to take the Second Wind by force, Fel storms off the ship. Within an hour, she finds four *veterans* who are willing to help her retake the ship. These veterans are armed with pistols (range 30/90 ft.) instead of heavy crossbows. If the Second Wind isn’t gone by the time she returns, Fel and her hired guns attack.
