# [[Ruthless Reigar]]

## NPCs
- [[Hastain]]

## Locations
- 

## Goal of Scene
- [ ] Party is pursued by [[Hastain]] in an [[esthetic]]
- [ ] 250' from party, [[Hastain]] casts [dimension door](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dimension-door)
- [ ] *COMBAT* 2nd round, [[Hastain]] uses [summon golem](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:summon-construct)
- [ ] *VICTORY* [[Hastain]] dies; [[esthetic]] uses Jammerscream
	- "You have won a victory, but at what cost? You're stranded without a functional [[spelljamming helm]], adrift in the vast ocean of Wildspace."
- [ ] *DEFEAT* 
	- If the characters and their allies are defeated, the reigar returns to the esthetic and commands it to demolish what’s left of the Second Wind. Enough of the ship’s air envelope remains to keep any surviving characters and crew members alive for 8 hours.
	- If Hastain prevails but the esthetic did not survive, the reigar takes control of the Second Wind and flies it back to the Rock of Bral, but only after jettisoning the characters and crew and leaving them with enough flotsam and jetsam around them to provide only an hour or two of breathable air.
