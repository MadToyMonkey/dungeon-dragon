## Recap

![[No games found#^summary]]

## Strong start

> "Now where were we... as yes, the pits of despair! What started as a simple notice board adventure as grown into a world of disaster. You've been cast out from your home world, pushed out into Wildspace. It had never dawned on you how small your world really was until you were watching it diminish in the background as you soared away. On a ship. That can fly."
> "You now find yourselves on a distant asteroid. In a relatively mundane tavern that has a room upstairs available for a few coin. At least its normal if you manage to ignore the Beholder running the bar. How are you starting your day?"
