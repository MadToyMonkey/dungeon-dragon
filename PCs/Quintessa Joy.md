So, on the topic of Quintessa. She studied a little of everything. I think due to her paternal parentage she may have had a special interest in devils and demons. She would have probably had multiple tutors growing up, all various members of the clergy that had differing special interests. Her main mentor would possibly be either her mother or the Mother of the nun portion of the clergy. Her actual mother would come and take her on special outings where they would go do activities that she was typically not allowed to do. As for a secret, could it possibly be that Quin had shown up to that island looking for an ancient book on the devil/demon group that names themselves after the Deadly Sins?

1st-level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also canâ€™t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
