### Storyteller Diary
- ![[Pasted image 20230220190330.png]]
- As the rest of the party decides to rest, Hubert and Ty decide they are not yet done exploring. As the rest of the party is discussing the events that just occured, Ty finds a secret doorway hidden in the bookshelf. Hubert notices and joins Ty walking through the doorway.
- Exiting the doorway puts the PCs coming through the wall in room 7. *Two large pipes feed into this room from deeper in the mountain. A small control sits between them. Above, light can be seen filtering in from a massive hole in the ceiling approximately 60 ft. up. Against the south wall, a giant metallic dragon statue dominates the space.*
- Ty investigates the statue while Hubert takes a look at the control. Hubert investigates the control by haphazardly pressing some of the buttons. Ty notices Hubert's actions and moves to assist. Ty finds a book stored near the control, but cannot read the words contained within. Finding the book useless at the current moment, Ty pockets it. Both Hubert and Ty are now pressing buttons in any order they can think of. Eventually, one of the combinations wakes the Iron Dragon statue.
- Quickly realizing the two are out matched, they make a made dash to the stairs in the corner of the room. As they are running, the dragon attempts a breath attack against them. Hubert fully escapes while Ty ends up a tad crispy but alive. With Hubert assisting Ty, they make it away from the dragon and to the bottom of the stairs.
- At the bottom of the stairs, there is an alcove. *The alcove contains wiring, piping, and a series of switches and buttons. It appears to have something to do with the statue and pipes in the room above.* Convinced the dragon will attempt to make its way down the stairs, Hubert stands at the ready at the end of the stairs. Feeling protected, Ty starts looking around. Ty quickly finds two other hidden doorways. After alerting Hubert, the two make their way into the north door.
- Within the room, *two man-sized statues stand at the far end of the room behind a partially closed curtain. To the left, two tables sit covered in various alchemical and arcane supplies. Beneath on of them, a small chest can be seen.* Seeing only arcana things of little interest, Hubert resumes watching the door and stairs awaiting the dragon. Ty on the other hand notices one of the bejeweled necks around one of the statues neck looks similar to the description Hubert had previously given. Ty gives the necklace to Hubert. Ty also grabs the robe the other statue was wearing. With another glace at the room, Hubert notices the chest and opens it. It is filled to the brim with coins. As the two grab the chest and make their way back out into the alcove, vicious noises of the dragon tearing at the upstairs archway can be heard.
- The PCs proceed to open the east door. Within this door is a modest closet with walls filled with runes. Ty quickly notice these runes are the same script that is in the console book he took from upstairs. Upon hearing more sounds from the dragon, the PCs settle into the closet with their winnings. After thoroughly securing the door, the PCs settle and rest.
