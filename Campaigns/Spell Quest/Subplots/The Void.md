### Subplot Notes
 - Card belongs to [[Tyraxis Silverscale]]
 - Tarot: Eight of Swords
 - Playing: Kind of Clubs
 - Tarokka: Mists
The Void. This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One of more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.
