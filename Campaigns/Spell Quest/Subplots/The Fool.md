### Subplot Notes
 - Card belongs to [[Bosun]]
 - Tarot: 0. The Fool
 - Playing: Joker (w/ Trademark)
 - Tarokka: Charlatan
You lose 10000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. if losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.
