### Location Details
 - Trap: Shock Field. There is a pressure plate on the ȵoor between the two curtains. Behind the curtains are coils of copper wire inlaid in the wall. If someone steps on the pressure plate they have to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw taking 5d6 lightning damage on a failure and half as much on a success. The trap can be discovered with a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check and disarmed with a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check. 
 - Treasure: Arcane Musings. The large diagram on the wall is of a water puriȴcation device left behind by the dwarves who previously inhabited this hold. It's worth 500 gp to the right buyer.
