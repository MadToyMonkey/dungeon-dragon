### Location Details
 - Encounter: Iron Dragon. The statue is an iron dragon. It uses the stat block for a young blue dragon except its type is construct, it speaks no languages, and its Intelligence is 4. If a character attempts to use the control panel, have them make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If they succeed, they deduce that the statue is in fact a construct and that pressing the right combination of buttons will permanently disable it. If they fail, it animates and attacks. It fights mindlessly, attacking whatever harmed it most recently, or whatever is closest. It uses its lightning breath whenever possible and isn't smart enough to save it for when it can hit multiple characters at once. When defeated, a viscous oil like substance leaks from its wounds and it groans to a halt.
