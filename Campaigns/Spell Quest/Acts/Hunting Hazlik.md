    you: "The players attempted asking Hazlik generic questions and then got frustrated and attacked."
    need: "Either they kill Hazlik and realize the domain is doomed or they talk amongst each other and begin to realize they have most of the information needed to successfully get out of Hazlan without the need to kill Hazlik."
    go: "The players want to kill Hazlik."
    search: "When looking around the library/study the party finds a Tarokka deck that when shuffled and dealt in a 3 card spread (or at least 3 cards are drawn) the details of the cards will suggest asking Hazlik about the mists. (*information [[Library Tarokka Deck]] available from [[Hazliks Study]]*)"
    find: "The current domain they are in will either begin to transform into yet another doomed domain or the Mists will decide Hazlik hasn't escaped yet even through death."
    take: "Asking Hazlik about the Mists will cause him to open the border. With the boundary open, whether Hazlik is alive or not, they will be able to enter the Mists without the threat of the magic experiments gone wrong attacking them. (*information [[Hazlik and the Border]] available from [[Hazlik]]*)"
    return: "Learn how to leave Hazlan with minimal resistance from the Mists."
    change: "Discover they have gotten Hazlik to open the border and then realize they need to find a talisman to a different Domain of Dread so they can successfully leave this one. Without a talisman the party will simply be stuck roaming the Mists until the Mists decided to let them enter a random Domain."
